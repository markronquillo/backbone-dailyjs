A Tutorial Project From http://dailyjs.com/2012/11/29/backbone-tutorial-1/ that deals with backbone and requirejs with Google API integration

Backbone.sync - is a function that Backbone calls everytime it attempts to read and save a model to the server

TODO:
Try to understand how server.js works
    To run server.js go to the directory then run "npm start"
    

Try to understand grunt.js config
    The file uses 'grunt-exec' plugin to run the RequireJs commands that generates a build of everything in the app/ directory
    RequireJS will minimize and concatenate the necessary files
    npm run-script grunt
